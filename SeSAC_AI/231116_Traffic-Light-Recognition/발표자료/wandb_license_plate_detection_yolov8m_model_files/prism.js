// This file used to import prism.js, but it was moved to be managed by
// va package.json
//
// This file remains behind as a useful entrypoint for getting code to client in case something goes wrong with the webpack files.
//
// An example from history: Service Workers became corrupted and blocked all refreshes of app.js
// Code is appending to this file to remove those service workers.
